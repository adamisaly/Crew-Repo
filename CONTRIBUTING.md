## General Workflow

1. Create an issue
  - Use github to create the issue
  - Add labels that apply to your issue
  - Add two milestones
    - A major milestone
    - A nightly milestone
2. Working on an issue
  - Create a branch that refernces the issue id you are working on
  ```bash
  git checkout -b crewapp/crewapp#40
  ```
  - Push your branch to github so waffle.io knows you are working on it
  ```bash
  git push origin crewapp/crewapp#40
  ```
3. Making commits to your feature branch.
  - Write a commit message that describes what the commit is doing
  - Once you feel a commit has fixed an issue, use one of these keywords in your commit message, and include `#40`
    - close, closes, closed
    - fix, fixes, fixed
    - resolve, resolves, resolved
  An example of how this would word:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "closes #40: added chat user"
  # or #
  git commit -m "closes #40"
  ```
4. Making pull requests
  - When you've finished with your fix or feature, Rebase upstream changes into your branch. Submit a pull request directly to master.
  - Include a description of your changes.
  - In the title of the pull request, it should be the same as message as your commit with they keyword above.
5. Review
  - Your pull request will be reviewed by two other maintainer. The point of code reviews is to help keep the codebase clean and of high quality and, equally as important, to help you grow as a programmer. If your code reviewer requests you make a change you don't understand, ask them why.
  - Fix any issues raised by your code reviwer, and push your fixes as a single new commit.
  - Once the pull request has been reviewed, it will be merged by another member of the team. Do not merge your own commits.
6. Post-Merge
  If you pull request was merged, you should delete the branch on local and remote
  Local Delete
  ```bash
  git branch -D crewapp/crewapp#40
  ```
  Remote Delete
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete crewapp/crewapp#40
  ```
#### Commit Message Guidelines

- Commit messages should be written in the present tense; e.g. "Fix continuous integration script".
- The first line of your commit message should be a brief summary of what the commit changes. Aim for about 70 characters max. Remember: This is a summary, not a detailed description of everything that changed.
- If you want to explain the commit in more depth, following the first line should be a blank line and then a more detailed description of the commit. This can be as detailed as you want, so dig into details here and keep the first line short.

### Rebase upstream changes into your branch

Once you are done making changes, you can begin the process of getting
your code merged into the main repo. Step 1 is to rebase upstream
changes to the master branch into yours by running this command
from your branch:

```bash
git pull --rebase upstream master
```

This will start the rebase process. You must commit all of your changes
before doing this. If there are no conflicts, this should just roll all
of your changes back on top of the changes from upstream, leading to a
nice, clean, linear commit history.

If there are conflicting changes, git will start yelling at you part way
through the rebasing process. Git will pause rebasing to allow you to sort
out the conflicts. You do this the same way you solve merge conflicts,
by checking all of the files git says have been changed in both histories
and picking the versions you want. Be aware that these changes will show
up in your pull request, so try and incorporate upstream changes as much
as possible.

You pick a file by `git add`ing it - you do not make commits during a
rebase.

Once you are done fixing conflicts for a specific commit, run:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

This will continue the rebasing process. Once you are done fixing all
conflicts you should run the existing tests to make sure you didnâ€™t break
anything, then run your new tests (there are new tests, right?) and
make sure they work also.

If rebasing broke anything, fix it, then repeat the above process until
you get here again and nothing is broken and all the tests pass.

### Make a pull request

Make a clear pull request from your fork and branch to the upstream master
branch, detailing exactly what changes you made and what feature this
should add. The clearer your pull request is the faster you can get
your changes incorporated into this repo.

At least one other person MUST give your changes a code review, and once
they are satisfied they will merge your changes into upstream. Alternatively,
they may have some requested changes. You should make more commits to your
branch to fix these, then follow this process again from rebasing onwards.

Once you get back here, make a comment requesting further review and
someone will look at your code again. If they like it, it will get merged,
else, just repeat again.

Thanks for contributing!

### Guidelines

1. Uphold the current code standard:
    - Keep your code DRY.
    - Follow [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md)
1. Run the tests before submitting a pull request.
1. Tests are very, very important. Submit tests if your pull request contains new, testable behavior.
